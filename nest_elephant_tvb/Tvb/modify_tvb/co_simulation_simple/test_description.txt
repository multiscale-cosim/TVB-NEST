 TheVirtualBrain-Scientific Package. This package holds all simulators, and
analysers necessary to run brain-simulations. You can use it stand alone or
in conjunction with TheVirtualBrain-Framework Package. See content of the
documentation-folder for more details. See also http://www.thevirtualbrain.org

Description of the different test in the folder :

modify_wongwang : test for compare the version in tvb and the modified version
modify_wongwang_precision : test for compare the version in tvb and the modified version
update_function : test the function of function_tvb
proxy_precision : compare the result between simulation with one proxy and without proxy
proxy_precision_delay : compare the result between simulation with one proxy and without proxy and different delay
proxy_precision_multiple : compare the result between simulation with 1-3 proxies and without proxy
double_proxy_precision_simple : test the transmission of information between two model with proxy in simple case
double_proxy_precision_complex : test the transmission of information between two model with proxy in most complex case
